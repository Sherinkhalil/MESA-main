# Agile Processes Group Assessment (Messup)

## How to add more tests:
Add a new function to test_functionalities.py. Its name should start with the word 'test'.
Import the functions to be tested from program.py and implement the test.

I'd suggest implementing all the required functionalities in seperate functions that can be tested on their own.
The main input loop should just be calling these functions when the appropriate command is entered.
We can look into tests with simulated user inputs later.
